# Pyber analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to look through a dataset containing "PyBer" data, a ride sharing app, and gathering insights from there. The main insights we looked into was splitting the city times into three seperate categories,"Rural","Urban", and "Suburban", to determine the total rides of each city type, total drivers in each city type,and the total fares and averages per ride/per driver.

# Pyber analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to look through a dataset containing "PyBer" data, a ride sharing app, and gathering insights from there. The main insights we looked into was splitting the city times into three seperate categories,"Rural","Urban", and "Suburban", to determine the total rides of each city type, total drivers in each city type,and the total fares and averages per ride/per driver.

## Results

  Here is the PyBer Summary dataframe, which contains the data mentioned above in the project overview. It's very useful to view the data with the rows as city type, which allows us to view how well each city type is doing. This summary dataframe shows us that urban has the most rides/drivers, with 1625 rides in total, and 2405 drivers in the area. Suburban comes in at 625 total rides, and 490 drivers, and Rural with 125 total rides and 78 drivers.

  Here this line chart shows us that the urban area has made the most in fares. Urban typically stays over 2000 dollars in total fares per month, while the Suburban area is in and out of the 1000 range, and the rural area stays sub 500.
  
## Summary
  In order to maximize capital gains, I would suggest PyBer to aim their marketing to suit the rural/suburban crowd. Along with that they should hire more drivers in the rural/suburban areas. I also think the average fare in the rural areas are high which might be limiting the amount of rides taken, but it could also be a high fare due to the fact that rural areas are usually more scattered.
